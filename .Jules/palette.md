## 2024-10-18 - Backend UX is API Documentation
**Learning:** In backend-only repositories (like WCF/SignalR), "User Experience" translates to "Developer Experience". Improving Swagger/OpenAPI metadata is the direct equivalent of adding ARIA labels or tooltips.
**Action:** When facing backend repos, look for API documentation gaps (missing descriptions, examples, summaries) as the primary "UX" contribution.
