## 2024-05-22 - DX is UX for Backend Services
**Learning:** In a backend-only WCF repository, the "User" is the Developer. Therefore, User Experience (UX) becomes Developer Experience (DX). Enhancing API documentation (Swagger) with metadata acts as the "UI" improvement.
**Action:** When assigned the Palette persona in a backend repo, focus on adding `[SwaggerWcfServiceInfo]` and `[Description]` attributes. Strictly avoid modifying method signatures or types, as those count as "Backend Logic" changes and break contracts.
