## 2026-01-31 - API Documentation as Developer Experience
**Learning:** In backend-only repositories, "User Experience" translates to "Developer Experience" (DX). The "interface" is the API itself. Adding Swagger/OpenAPI metadata (`[SwaggerWcfPath]`, `[Description]`) is the equivalent of adding ARIA labels to UI components—it makes the invisible visible and accessible to the consumer.
**Action:** When tasked with UX in a backend service, audit the API surface area. Add descriptive attributes to endpoints and data models to reduce friction for consuming developers.
